	abstract="This paper studies various computational and decisional Diffie-Hellman problems by providing reductions among them in the high granularity setting. We show that all three variations of computational Diffie-Hellman problem: square Diffie-Hellman problem, inverse Diffie-Hellman problem and divisible Diffie-Hellman problem, are equivalent with optimal reduction. Also, we are considering variations of the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem in single sample and polynomial samples settings, and we are able to show that all variations are equivalent except for the argument DDH {\$}{\backslash}Leftarrow{\$}SDDH. We are not able to prove or disprove this statement, thus leave an interesting open problem.",
